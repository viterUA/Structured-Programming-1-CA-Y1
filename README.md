# Structured Programming 1 â€“ Continuous Assessment (Year 1)

## Overview

This repository contains solutions and supporting materials for the *Structured Programming 1* continuous assessment assignments for **Year 1** students. It includes Python programs, exam/assessment PDFs, and documentation for string handling. The purpose is to showcase properly structured, readable code and to provide reference examples for coursework.

## Purpose & Learning Goals

* Practice writing clean, maintainable structured code in Python.
* Work with basic programming constructs: variables, loops, conditionals, functions.
* Manipulate strings, read/write files (if applicable), and follow project/assessment specifications.
* Develop problem-solving skills by implementing algorithms as per assignment requirements.

## Usage

You can use the files in this repo to:

1. Review how assignments/continuous assessments are solved.
2. Compare different solution approaches (where multiple versions exist).
3. Learn or revise Python string methods and general structured programming style.
4. Prepare for similar tasks / future assessments by practising with existing exam PDFs.

## How to Run

If you want to test the Python programs locally:

1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory and run, for example:

   ```bash
   python MykhailoHnylytskyi.py
   ```

   (or replace with whichever `.py` file you want to test).
4. If inputs are required (stdin / command-line / file), follow prompts or open/edit as needed.

## Contributing

* If you add new assessment solutions, name them clearly (e.g. `LastnameCA4.py`).
* Keep consistent formatting (indentation, naming, comments) to maintain readability.
* If you update documentation (e.g. for Python string methods), ensure references are current.
